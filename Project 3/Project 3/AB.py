# Chess Pieces: King, Queen, Knight, Bishop, Rook (First letter capitalized)
# Colours: White, Black (First Letter capitalized)
# Positions: Tuple. (column (String format), row (Int)). Example: ('a', 0)

# Parameters:
# gameboard: Dictionary of positions (Key) to the tuple of piece type and its colour (Value). This represents the current pieces left on the board.
# Key: position is a tuple with the x-axis in String format and the y-axis in integer format.
# Value: tuple of piece type and piece colour with both values being in String format. Note that the first letter for both type and colour are capitalized as well.
# gameboard example: {('a', 0) : ('Queen', 'White'), ('d', 10) : ('Knight', 'Black'), ('g', 25) : ('Rook', 'White')}
#
# Return value:
# move: A tuple containing the starting position of the piece being moved to the new position for the piece. x-axis in String format and y-axis in integer format.
# move example: (('a', 0), ('b', 3))
